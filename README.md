# English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)

This study aims to investigate longitudinal associations between self-report physical activity, grip strength, gait speed and cognition utilising latent physical and cognitive variable constructs. More specifically, whether increased grip strength and gait speed predicts higher cognitive performance and whether there is a reverse causal effect.
