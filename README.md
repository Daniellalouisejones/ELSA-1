# English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)

This study aims to investigate longitudinal associations between self-report physical activity, grip strength, gait speed and cognition utilising latent physical and cognitive variable constructs. More specifically, whether increased grip strength and gait speed predicts higher cognitive performance and whether there is a reverse causal effect.

There are seven waves of data available in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) dataset. We selected executive function, memory function, orientation function and processing speed as measures of the latent cognitive ability. Note that the executive function is missing at wave 6. Grip strengths of dominant and non-dominant hands and gait speed variables are selected to measure the latent physical ability. Variables that are not found in the dataset but should be are indicated as `unknown`.

The hypothetical cognitive variables are:
| Vriable | Name in ELSA | Waves | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| executive function | `exe` | 1 2 3 4 5 7 | index of executive function (verbal fluency) |
| memory | `mem` | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | index of memory function |
| orientation | `unknown` | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | index of orientation function |
| speed | `unknown` | 1 2 3 4 5 | index of processing speed |
